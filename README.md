# Coding-Challenge-3
In this challange I need to create a class with two properties: 'make' and 'speed.'
I need to add functions that alter the 'speed' of any object by increasing it by 10, or decreasing it by 5.
Finally, I need to run these functions multiple times with two objects whose data was provided.
